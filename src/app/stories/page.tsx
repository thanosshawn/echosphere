// To avoid a route conflict or duplicate content at /stories, this page should either
// redirect to `/` or be deleted if `/stories` is no longer a desired distinct path for listing stories.
// For this operation, we are effectively removing the page content from this path.
// If you want to delete the file itself, you can do so.
// If you want to redirect /stories to /, you would modify next.config.js.
// For now, rendering null will make this path show nothing.
